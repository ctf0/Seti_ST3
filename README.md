# Notes
- This is my first of its kind so if you found any bugs ,please issue a ticket.

- The Theme is considered in beta-ish.

- I included a folder with some files types from `jesseweed` and `DanBrooker` to test the icons ,you should probably add some of them to the "file_exclude_patterns" as ST wont open them anyway.

- Any thing less than 'ST3 Build 3062' wont get the sidebar icons to work.


## Install

### Via Package Control

Theme is listed as `Seti_UI` in Will Bond's [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net).

### Manual

1. [Download the .zip](https://github.com/ctf0/Seti_ST3/archive/master.zip).
2. Unzip and rename the folder to ```Seti_UI```.
3. Copy the folder into `Packages` directory, which you can find using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...` in Sublime Text.
4. copy the (fold.png) "or edit it to ur liking" to ```Packages/Theme - Default``` to override the _focken default yellow icon.

## Setup

Activate the UI theme and color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Preferences -> Settings - User` in Sublime Text or get `Schemr` & `Themr` by [Ben Weier](https://github.com/benweier).

### Example settings
```
{
  "theme": "Seti.sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Seti_UI/Seti.tmTheme",
  "caret_extra_width": 2 // to have a wider/thicker caret
}
```

## Differences from the original

- No file icon in the opened tabs, ST lacks this.

- Not as icon rich as the original because ST can't see anything other than Extensions ,and even thou its still hard to make it use the icon you want "thats why some icons are duplicated".

- Some scopes have different colors in Atom like the (:) ,this is related to the tmLanguage file in ST ,also note that Atom sometimes will display a different color than ST "even if both editors have the same scope name".

- Current line number highlight color, ST lacks this.

- Everything else is basically the same as the original except for a couple of UI colors.


## TODOS

1. Make the search input field shorter or "slimier" (depend on which side of the earth you are living).
2. haven't tested on Retina ,so anyone with Retina Mac plz test and report any found bugs.


## Issue A Ticket
 1. what version of ST are you using ? (nothing lower than 3062);
 2. have you restarted ST after you installed the theme ?
 3. if you still have bad render ,have you removed the cashe folder ? (found right next to the packages folder);
 4. have you copied the files from the "Ext" folder to your User folder ?
