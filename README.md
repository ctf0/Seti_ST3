# Notes

- I included a folder with some files types from `jesseweed` and `DanBrooker` to test the icons ,you should probably add some of them to the "file_exclude_patterns" as ST wont open them anyway.

- Any thing less than 'ST3 Build 3062' wont get the sidebar icons to work.

- if you used any of the resources in this repo into your own release ,plz appreciate the hard work and mention the original authors.

- A New/Better syntax Highlight released under [Seti_UX](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Seti_UX).

## Differences from the original

- No file icon in the opened tabs, ST lacks this.

- Not as icon rich as the original because ST can't see anything other than Extensions ,and even thou its still hard to make it use the icon you want.

- Some scopes have different colors in Atom like the (:) ,this is related to the tmLanguage file in ST ,also note that Atom sometimes will display a different color than ST "even if the scope name matches in both editors".

- Current line number highlight color, ST lacks this.

- Everything else is basically the same as the original except for a couple of UI colors.

## Issue A Ticket

1. what version of ST are you using ? (nothing lower than 3062).

2. have you restarted ST after you installed the theme ?.

3. if you still have bad render ,have you removed the cache folder ? (found right next to the packages folder).

4. have you copied the files from the "Ext" folder to your User folder ?.
